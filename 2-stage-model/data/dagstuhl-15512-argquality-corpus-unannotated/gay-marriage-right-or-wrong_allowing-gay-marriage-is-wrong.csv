12402	0.00504	From a religious standpoint gay marriage isn't even possible. Let along right. But everyone isn't religious or adheres to specific religious guidance. <br/> Marriage is defined as between a woman and a man. So the word "marriage" may be misused in this case. Civil unions, well that's a different matter.
12414	0.00558	I vote "Wrong". It goes against human nature and, as other fellow voters have mentioned, the definition of "Marriage". <br/> And you can't exclude religion from this argument, because thats what happened when people don't have faith or belief in any religion. Religion is there to act as guidelines to what is right and what is wrong. Religion is a way of life. Without it, we're lost.
12421	0.00429	The real issue is - why is the government involved in this issue at all? We take a personal, religious institution and regulate it, then the government comes back and wants to redefine it. <br/> It should not be a political issue, because my personal, religious things should be separate from government regulation. <br/> Marriage and the government should not mix. That solves the "problem".
12430	0.00793	If being homosexual was natural then <br/> 1. There would only be possibly 6 people on the earth...meaning none of the people making up these sarcastic remakes would be around....heck I wouldn't be around <br/> 2. If homosexuality was natural then the butthole would be in the front part of the body. <br/> Its never been accepted as "natural" by society only till now. So i'm pretty sure thousands of years of recorded human history have a little more weight than some piss ant liberal venting on how its unfair.
12431	0.00459	I did not propose "separate but equal." I proposed "distinct and different." Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships. If the law is to contemplate man/woman relationships intelligently, it has to be able to isolate them. <br/> A law requiring separate schools and public accomodations for homosexual people would violate "separate but equal." Law defining marriage as a man/woman relationship does not.
12466	0.01023	gays are overrated. it is another "look at me" stunt. i think gays are the product of overly protective parents, abuse, or liberal wakoness (it should be a disease). <br/> if you gays would stop calling attention to yourselves, nobody would really care what you do.
31527	0.00457	The Marriage issue should be out of politicians and lawmakers. Marriages are for the Church to decide, Congress have no power to pass a legislation forcing religious institutions about marriage. Maybe, if the courts were to allow gay marriage, it would be alright since it is not a religious institution, it doesn't break the Separation between Church and State ruled by the Supreme Court.
42624	0.00445	An action is ethical if society as a whole would benefit if we all did it. Fair enough? <br/> If everyone had a gay marriage, then society as a whole would NOT benefit. In fact, we would all become extinct, because without one man and one woman there would be no reproduction and continuation of our species. <br/> Therefore, gay marriage can't be ethical. <br/> You can't refute my statement by saying, "There will always be straight people" because that's like saying killing someone is right because there will always be those who won't kill.
69708	0.09900	Of course its wrong. <br/> Why do you think Aids exists?
76796	0.00446	Why don't we just get rid of any incentive to be married, politically that is. No tax deductions, no married filing jointly; nothing. Let the churches perform marriages, get the government out completely. If a particular denomination wants to condone homosexuality let them, it's them that are going against their religion. <br/> I don't support it. Like I said, if there were not tax breaks or incentives to be married in the eyes of the state, who cares. My church doesn't support it. It irks me that people who claim to Christians support it and even allow homosexual clergy.
