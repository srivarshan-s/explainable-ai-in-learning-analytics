arg108968	0.05045	When the U.S. fought the Brits for their independence, the Brits wore a red uniform. Every time the Americans saw a British soldier, they would yell, "The red coats are coming, the red coats are coming." <br/> If India ever tried to take over the U.S., Americans would be forced to yell, "The red dots are coming, the red dots are coming." ;)
arg118518	0.00498	India... where they have like a whole class of opressed people and a huge wealth differences? And with a language that the majority of the world can't understand and doesn't want to understand? India's education quality has nothing compared to Western education and it's the superpowers that control the world's economy. <br/> I highly doubt India will ever lead the world, and it doesn't even have the potential to. It should leave that to the superpowers.
arg118660	0.00692	India has the potential to lead because it has the second largest man power n third largest army in the world n it is a country full of hopes n aspirations n for Indians nothing is impossible, n we r proud to be Indians n we will lead the world n be the king of the world in every manner. even 34% scientists in NASA are Indians.
arg122478	0.00513	i think, the india is not ready to lead the world because of many reasons.. <br/> 1.) the politians of our country are involved in black money cases. they try to gain or earn money as possible. <br/> 2.) they always try to make a big issue of useless topics. e.g., if a politian says something about another politian, they try to make it a big issue .
arg126375	0.00484	well, India is finding difficult to manage itself first...so there's no question of leading the world so far....but still if we compare so lets have a look at the following points: <br/> 1. almost 90% of India is illiterate(don't be sure of the percentage), so an illiterate country can't lead the world.... <br/> 2.India is more into castes, politics, religions and less into development. <br/> 3.the most important thing is that India doesn't have confidence on itself and is still cursing itself... <br/> So if it goes on so then it is difficult or even impossible to say that "INDIA WILL LEAD THE WORLD WHEN IT CANNOT LEAD ITSELF!!"
arg132199	0.00537	according to a recent report 50% scientists in NASA are indian IITians, just imagine that if those scientists will join ISRO then our status,value and astronomical knowledge of india will definetly increase. <br/> Now,think abt. IITians,students who are qualifying iit, they are known to be superbrain.If India is capable of opening hitech institutions,then why we are unable provide them a perfect job of their level.we are giving international status of education.then why unable to take best advantages from them.this is due to brain drain,lack of industrial development,suitable working environment as well as proper salary.so its the need of the hour to improve our industrial sector.
arg145468	0.00469	All we can say is a big IF because we are not yet 100% sure if this nation itself could lead the whole world. Who knows maybe in the future that India could fail to lead us. There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people. India is not yet that full of technologies like in the Americas. Well in fact technology is one of the most sophisticated and essential inventions ever created.
arg155750	0.06995	stupid india they actually really suck. so, BOO INDIA BOO!
