13989	0.00895	The question is: who has the right to prohibit it? Government? Why would there be any pressing need at all for the state to outlaw pornography? Look at Europe- they're cool with pretty much everything. I don't see any moral depravity in Europe, do you?
13993	0.14867	No porn is not wrong. As an abstract noun, it cannot be wrong.
13998	0.00549	me and my wife share an exciting and passionate love life. we love the porn. we pop it on and use it to kick it up a notch. set the room on fire. for us itt is a way to share and expand the love we enjoy together in the bedroom. <br/> so as long as it is legal and everyone is of age then there should be no problem.
14000	0.00542	Porn is anything but wrong in most cases. Sometimes it's in very bad taste, but when it's giving equal gratification, etc. to all parties, there's nothing wrong, and I could even consider it an art form in some respects.
14002	0.00500	If pornography and the people who produce it were well respected by society, then no argument could be made that porn was degrading anyone. <br/> Likewise, if, as a society we were to berate movie actors (for example), then the act of being an actor would become degrading. <br/> It isn't the act of producing the porn that needs to change, but rather the acceptance of it in society.
14003	0.00484	Easy access to porn may be the reason there has been an 85 percent decline in rapes over the last 25 years, according to a law professor at Northwestern University.
14007	0.01377	Porn isn't wrong, as long as you aren't doing it behind your partner's back. <br/> It's only degrading to the women who choose to pose.
37675	0.00526	Porn is entertainment. Is it wrong and evil to have swear words in songs, because some people don't like it? Of course not. Should sex scenes in movies or TV shows be illegal? Nope. If you do not like porn, don't watch it. If you like it, it is your right to watch it.
54763	0.00555	Porn isn't inherently wrong because It really can't substantially harm anyone who isn't involved in it by choice.It really is just as simple as that.
73596	0.00577	All these arguments about that porn leads to addiction are annoying me now -_- . Porn hardly ever leads to addiction, just in weak people, maybe who have mental health issues, or attachment issues or find it hard to separate fantasy from reality. I watch porn once or twice a day when i'm on my own but also have a great boyfriend and we have sex once or twice (sometimes three, if i'm lucky!) times a week, we use porn to spice things up in the bedroom but we know it's all fantasy, we're not idiots, we just have desires that need to be met!
