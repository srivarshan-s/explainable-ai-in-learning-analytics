arg229317	0.00625	Christianity strives to promote better morals and ethics. What does atheism contribute? Nothing. To believe that one should follow the ways of Christ, what harm is there. Real or not, Christ is still a better example to follow than any atheist. For a ideology to be better than any human must really piss off those that fall way short of it.

arg236317	0.10461	This is just wrong we should not insult who we believe in we do not need to know what you people think
arg236641	0.00690	I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.
arg244440	0.00673	Atheism is based on science, but faith is based on the soul. An atheist is always looking for the absence of God, but religious person just believes. Atheism should be constantly fed, but faith shouldn't be. <br/> Although I'm religious person, I think atheist can stand to hear besause everyone is indepent and everyone has to have his own opinion.
arg289787	0.01851	Christianity of course. Can't imagine life if I didn't believe in God. Actually I can, it would be hell.
arg317490	0.01849	I have a personal relationship with Christ. I do believe.
arg636360	0.00671	One of the key component to Christianity is FAITH. Just you because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. Gravity, for example, you can't see it, feel it, or hear it, but you know it's there. Faith to Christians is the same way.
arg644073	0.00646	Christianity does offer hope in the world. Christianity does tell others to help the poor.
