I grew up without a father and if I had a choice of being a billionaire or to have a father growing up, I'd choose to have a father. I'm basically a bastard legally because he isn't even on my birth certificate. No one should grow up without a father because honestly, it messes with them. Kids in school will ask about your dad and you have nothing to say. Whether he is lousy or not, a child should always be in touch with their dad. Even if he isn't with the mother anymore.
arg35615	0.01046	Even though your father might not be the best or always there for you he is still your father. Every father has a certain connection with there children and thats what shapes and molds a son or daughters character and personality. I believe our parents play a major role in determining who we are even if they are lousy they are still our kin.
arg35619	0.00769	There is scientific evidence that shows having a mother and a father is the healthiest way for a child to progress physically and mentally. <br/> So a lousy father is better than none.(that is of course assuming that he is not abusive in any way) <br/> Also, people change. Who says that he will be lousy forever. There are family therapy sessions you can attend to help.
arg35635	0.00868	I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world. A lousy father is not that bad because what exactly makes a lousy father, always working and not having time for you. A father that isn't always around is no reason to prefer to have no father. Growing up and seeing the way your father is, makes you want to become like him or gives you the motivation to surpass him and become even better than he is.
arg35650	0.00821	I think that it will be better to have an lousy father than no father. A least you have an father. You know who he is and where he is. You will also kinda get an idea on what you going to be when you go up. If he is an lousy father, that will help you not be what he is. You can say that it is motivation that will help you became an better father. Because you don't want to be like your father. You want to better that your father, in-fact that should motivate you to be the greatest father you can be.
arg35676	0.01142	I wouldn't live my life right if I never got to meet my father. I wouldn't care if I grew up and had lousy father even if he has no job or life and maybe even an alcohlic. Having a father means alot especially if your boy because most fathers are friends to, so you can talk to them about guy problems and they would understand the situation and with just living with your mother you couldn't because she's a woman and her views are different then a guy. Whether its a good or lousy father they will always be there for you at sometime in life.
arg35698	0.02064	Its better to have a lousy father then not have one at all. Even if you have a lousy father you can still learn from him. You can tell yourself, "I'm not going to be like him, I'm going to be better". Even if you have a lousy father his going to love you no matter what.
arg35700	0.02899	I would have to choose a lousy father. I think having a father figure around even though he might not do much for you or the family is better than none. A father to me plays a huge role in a childs life he keeps thing stable throughout your childhood. My father is pretty lousy but he does support me and helps out sometimes I would rather have a father than none.
arg35720	0.12782	I think is better to have a lousy Father than to be Fatherless, maybe having one is not that bad, other than living with the idea you didn't had one or with the doubt of how could it be to have one.
arg35726	0.00835	It would be better to have a lousy father than to not a have a father at all. If you were to grow up with out a father you would always have that empty void feeling about it. And if your father is lousy it helps you strive to be better than him. It could also cause you to start being responsible faster because the father isn't taking care of business. Like me and my brother, my father is lousy but I'm still happy i know who he is. Just because i cant imagine wondering about it.
