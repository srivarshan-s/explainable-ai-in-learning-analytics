arg135637	0.30476	TV is terrible. Except for Spongebob maybe. That's an alright show. Still, the majority of television is awful. So I'd have to say books based on that.
arg135648	0.00835	One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, East of Eden, Nabokov's Lolita, 1984, Martian Chronicles - I could go on and on. For real. There's very little that beats the world described in books.

arg159445	0.00575	Books offer improvement with grammar and spelling skills. Plus it's more creative. With TV everything is done for you.

arg213555	0.00575	Books enlighten the soul. Books don't destroy the morals of children. Books throw the mind into a series of questions, they take the readers to mystical places, paradise, and even the kitchen sink. They change your perspective on life and often give the reader a sense of relativity. Television is like a drug. It's as bad as nicotine. Fahrenheit 451, the Night Circus, The Secret Garden, Inkheart... Do I have to further explain..?
arg223675	0.00580	I think books are better as TV can cause obesity as many people just sit infront of it, it has been proven to cause violence and it reduces learning. Also, books increase someones imagination and creativity as they have to imagine things in the book for themselves. <br/> I am not completely against TV but I do believe that TV is very bad in large amounts and books are very good for people <br/> http://www.echoworld.com/B05/B0510/B0510TVBad.htm
