arg168774	0.01608	Farquhar was the one to implement the actual operations, whereas Raffles only came up with the ideas, which would or would not work. Actions require action, and Farquhar implemented those ideas.
arg168779	0.12881	Farquhar was unjustly exiled by Raffles even though William had done a lot to help Singapore.
arg168780	0.00864	Faruhar carried out the 'grand plan' of Raffles'. Raffles practically just sat there and watched it all go, not even lifting a finger to help. It doesn't matter if Raffles was the head of the so-called operation, Farquhar was the one to DEVELOP Singapore to what it is today.
arg168801	0.00846	Farquhar contributed significantly, even forking out his own money to start up the colony carved out of the jungle, by first offering money as an incentive for people to hunt and to exterminate rats and centipedes. Raffles did nothing of that sort.
arg168804	0.00859	Faquhar solved the problems in Singapore using cash from his own pocket. When Singapore was once infested with rats and centipedes, Farquhar rewarded the people with coins for every pest they catch. This solved the problem quickly, as he held to his promise.
arg168807	0.04246	William Farquhar had helped more citizen of Singapore than Raffles did. Raffles was just more of the idea man. William Farquhar was more of a founder of Singapore than Raffles.
arg168818	0.00768	To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.
arg168822	0.00846	Raffles neglected Singapore when he went around conquering other 'more useful' countries for about FOUR years, leaving all the work to Farquhar to settle. Plus, to drive my point further, the countries that were run by Raffles all ended up BADLY. This shows that Raffles was a bad developer of the country.
arg168830	0.01801	Raffles came and left Singapore, returning after a long period of time. Farquar stayed here all the time, and solved many problems. Raffles did not do much at all compared to Farquar.
arg168834	0.00791	Raffles doesn't care about the citizens, doesn't spare a thought at all. <br/> So what if he discovered the island majulah singapura, he did not help in the least in singapore's development. so why in the world should he deserve the title of 'singapore's founder'? <br/> Farquhar developed the island, with all his ideas contributing to the development.
