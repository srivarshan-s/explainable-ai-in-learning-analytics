12365	0.00847	(I am writing this through Firefox) Emotions aside, Firefox has no ActiveX support. It makes it unusable for at least the new wonder tool, Windows VirtualEarth.
12367	0.00629	Firefox (and the extensions) leaks memory like a sieve. An opened session of Firefox 2.0.0.1, three tabs, one week, uses 250  Meg of memory under Task Manager on Windows.
12371	0.00608	I was a IE user from the beginning, but recently I started using Firefox. Apart from the obvious differences like availability of tabs in Firefox which was not avaible in IE I don't find any other significant advantages in using firefox. Also now IE7 has got the tabs feature included, along with add-ons to provide different functionalities. <br/> So I think IE is better than firefox.
12380	0.00556	I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues <br/> First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start. <br/> Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly. <br/> Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.
12383	0.00581	I used to be a firefox user but I only have 2GBs of RAM on my system and I like to use more than one program at a time. Firefox sucks up way too much memory to justify the one or two advantages.
12388	0.00574	IE7 on Vista supports protected mode which runs the browser in a security context that has minimal access to your computer and private information. Both Firefox and IE are internet facing apps with occasional security issues, so I prefer the browser with better security architecture.
33187	0.00657	Coming from a casual internet user, I prefer IE because it has a sleeker design, and I find the bookmark/history thing easier. I'm using firefox though, cuz I don't want to transfer my bookmarks again after my brother made it my default browser.
65125	0.18167	Chorme beats all its the fastest and the safest plus its also open source like firefox
65191	0.02811	Well personally I believe Google Chrome is the S*** but Firefox crashes every time I use it.
71467	0.00962	Most of the government sites in India is designed only for IE, so it is important to have IE in your computer
