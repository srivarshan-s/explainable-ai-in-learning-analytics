1633	0.00594	If a woman is raped and left with the bastard child of the man who raped her and severely emotionally traumatized her, she should have the decision to give up that baby. Certain circumstances call for desperate decisions and this is one, the choice should be her's to make and she should be allowed to make it.
1641	0.01201	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. <br/> If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.
1661	0.00746	While I personally do not think that abortion is right in any way shape or form. I do not believe the government has the right to make that decision. This is a decision to be made by the parents of the unborn child. NOT the government.
1683	0.02420	In the United States of America, pro-choice is the only constitutional way to go. Elsewhere in the world, people will do whatever they want.
28415	0.00614	Giving up a child has to be one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make in her life. Have you any idea the responsibility and maturity it takes to make such an important decision? <br/> If a woman can not support a child(Either emotionally, physically, or financially) she should have right to choose to give up that child.
28498	0.00809	The only other choices are, adoption or keep it. <br/> And I know many children get adopted but many don't <br/> and it might be better off to just have an abortion to <br/> let them suffer. <br/> That's the chance they take, I guess. But who are we to <br/> decide one womans pregnancy.
37929	0.00633	Im going to take the Obama approach to this <br/> Abortion is never something a women would take lightly there will always be a lot of thinking asking for help and even praying involved with making that decision. The pro-life people just don't seam to understand that we also think the abortion is a sad and awful thing and we pro-choicers hope nobody would ever have to make this difficult and life altering situation. there for this decision should be left to the women and not some man miles away in d.c. that has never faced it
63512	0.00615	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.
69016	0.01372	Who are we to judge what is right or wrong? Can we not just let people make decisions and live with the consequences?
74039	0.00689	You don't know these girl's/women's stories, who are you to judge what they can or can't do? Until you've walked a mile in these girl's/women's shoes, than you may have the opportunity to speak on their behalf. Until then, you may not have to like it and may stand firm with your opinion, but at least have the audacity to respect other's opinions on the subject matter.
