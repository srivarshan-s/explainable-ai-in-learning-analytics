arg107445	0.02058	i think that PE clases should be obligatory in school to help the problem of obecity.
arg107456	0.00733	Most people think that PE classes are completely useless because the only thing you would normally do in a PE class is run around. But there is more to a PE class then just running around the field for an hour. With physical education you can get muscles, you can become stronger, it wouldn't be so easily for you to become fat (of course you would also need to keep a balanced diet) and for further ages (like 60-80) it would prevent you from having heart attacks. With the help of this class there would be fewer obese children around the globe and more fit and strong people.
arg148559	0.00756	I think it is great idea to make physical education be mandatory in school because it will be healthy for the student to become a healthy person and they will not have the risk of obesity.
arg213068	0.02202	How are we supposed to curb childhood obesity if we don't start at a young age?
arg230691	0.00748	schools should have PE because the school i attend only has pe for middle school not high school we are a middle and a high school combined. because the lack of physical education in our high school many students are out of shape and have developed many bad non active habits and as our first year in sports our sports athletes have shown how hard it is to perform simple pre season conditioning and they quote "if we had PE conditions would be easier and would have made conditioning simple" the lack of exercise had caused them to only accomplish only 3 push-ups!
arg260899	0.00886	Yes. Physical education, if taught and encouraged properly and approached with the right attitude, will be rewarding for both student and teacher.
arg345997	0.00789	I feel like Physical education should be mandatory because people need there exercise. If they don't get physical activity they wont burn as much fats as they accumulate thus will get chubbier. They should be stricter during those classes of Physical education because a lot of the time people mostly just stand around. I don't want to seem sexist, but the ones that get the least exercise are the girls and they just mostly stand there and socialize. They need a way to keep everyone active, people need to get moving! They need this for there health!
arg37974	0.11337	Kids are fat these days.. p.e. helps!!1!!!!!one!!!! <br/> and itll help them relize heath is important for there lame ass futures lol
arg54258	0.00731	PE should be compulsory because it keeps us constantly fit and healthy. If you really dislike sports, then you can quit it when you're an adult. But when you're a kid, the best thing for you to do is study, play and exercise. If you prefer to be lazy and lie on the couch all day then you are most likely to get sick and unfit. Besides, PE helps kids be better at teamwork.
arg7751	0.00764	It should be mandatory because being active and getting involved in sports, even through PE, helps children develop good habits later on in life. Plus, there's the benefit of working together as a team that doesn't always happen in other classes.
