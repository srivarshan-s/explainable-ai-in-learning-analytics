Which at the end of the day affects how men perceive women which will in turn lead to a lot of disrespect and false perception. <br/> Now, how about crime rates? Murders, Rape, and Sexual Abuse. According to studies, all these people who committed these grave crimes all had one thing in common: PORN.

29278	0.00635	Porn is definitely wrong. Porn is like an addiction to some people which is unhealthy and can lead to guilt and lust. An addiction to porn gives an unhealthy image of real sex. Porn promotes the fact that sex is totally based on pleasure, but it is actually based on love and affection also. Porn inspired numerous crimes that sometimes abuse the rights and virginity of many people.
29393	0.00652	Porn is wrong when it is not done in moderation. Porn addicts turn out to have intimacy issues in their relationships and mistreat and view women in a negative manner. Also people who are addicted to porn, expect all women to look like porn stars and act like porn stars, when in reality that is not what sex is about... But it tends to screw up their reality.
39342	0.00704	The argument that porn would expose one to the reality in life, and thus increasing one's maturity and prevent possible future sexual assaults, is totally crap. <br/> porn is definitely wrong. after a dosage, the guilt of wasting ur time, wasting energy, wasting effort and not devoting urself to another thing and regretting that you should not have started would almost kill you. trust me. <br/> its a road that shld not be taken, its as bad as smoking and dugs. i think the only reason its not banned in most developed countries is that they are facing an aging population.
54187	0.00651	If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.
