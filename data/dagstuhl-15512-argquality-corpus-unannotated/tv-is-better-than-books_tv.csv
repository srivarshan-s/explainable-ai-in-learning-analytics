arg363603	0.00478	I think TV is better if you are watching an informational channel and it is better than books because you can switch to different informational channels an search documentaries on different subjects and when you are done learning and ready to relax you can switch to a funny show or what ever you want to watch.
arg376774	0.00903	TV is better because you can just explore the world while sitting on a couch
arg399267	0.00464	If you can only understand or speak a specific language but you move to another country then most of the books are not in your language but TV comes in all different languages and you can also hear how the words are pronounced in a different language.
arg399268	0.01015	you can get the "Foxtel Go" app on your Ipad so you can watch TV where ever and whenever you want.
arg399270	0.00477	Without TV actors/actresses wouldn't have jobs. <br/> Without TV you wouldn't know what's happening around the world. I mean the newspapers can't fit all that in. <br/> Books and newspapers can't give you emergency warnings or updates or new flashes
arg470033	0.00429	I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in a limit, because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. <br/> Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened and watched.
arg479199	0.00453	TV is better than books because the educational programs on TV are much more convenient and easy to understand. It is also easy to use for people who cannot see or hear. Books are also likely to be not updated with latest information about a certain topic while information from TV can be much more accurate and useful.

arg561428	0.00621	TV ,,!! because you can get information from different resources in a short time ,,, but Books you must read a lot to get that much of information !!
arg585674	0.00439	A picture is worth a thousand words. TV lets you see and hear a story, or information. Imagine just reading about the recent disasters in Japan, Alabama and Missouri vs. seeing them and seeing interviews with survivors. Much more powerful and immediate on TV. <br/> Books take too much time. TV gives the info much faster.
