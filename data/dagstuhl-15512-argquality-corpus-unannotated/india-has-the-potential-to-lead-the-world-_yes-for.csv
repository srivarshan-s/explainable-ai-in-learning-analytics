India has provided a huge opportunity to enhance trade and investments in sectors such as mechanical and electrical engineering, food processing, automotive, tourism and banking among others. Almost every multinational company is focusing on India.
arg106426	0.01291	Do we have the potential? <br/> Yes. <br/> The only competition we have is China who has done a much better job for the long run. <br/> But then again the way India runs.. it always makes order out of chaos.
arg116888	0.00660	Yes. India does have the potential to lead the world. If the Indian government can look after a country with 28 states of 28 ways, culture, geographical and language, it can certainly can lead the world. For example, there is heavy rainfall in Manipur , while there is water scarcity in Rajasthan. It also has the most wonderful technological developments. Economically also India isn't that low. Eg: Chandrayaan from India discovered water on Moon. What do u say about that? And the father of astronomy, aryabhatta was from India.

arg126378	0.00628	The Indian economy is galloping at a breakneck speed and might even reach double-digit growth by 2013, feel Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. Many economists agree that the demographic dividend that India enjoys could see the country sustain its high growth rate for a long time to come. <br/> The India growth story is indeed enviable. Despite being plagued by myriad problems, India has emerged stronger and more resilient to any global crises so far. <br/> India is expected to be the world's fastest growing economy by 2018, according to Economist Intelligence Unit, a research arm of the Economist magazine.

arg623493	0.00678	I am an American, and I am ashamed to admit "Merica is rich due to slavery. India never had slavery and used to be rich until the British came and took everything away. We were left in a bad state, but started developing quickly. India is much more competitive in education than America and soon when everyone has education (which will happen in our lifetime) India will excel. <br/> India has the potential.
