arg35591	0.01106	In my opinion, I believe it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I wouldnt know how it feel to have a lousy father but I have friends that there fathers are always drunk and never do anything to help them. They sometimes tell me they wish there dad wasn't around. Now if my dad was like that I would think the same because at least by not having a father you wouldnt know how it feels to be dissapointed by a father.
arg35616	0.01128	Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.
arg35622	0.01988	I think it would be better fatherless the reason why is because i have never had a father in my life. I think that if you have a lousy father you will be taught to be lousy just like him. Parents are supposed to be setting examples for their kids, not just be lazy and that type of thing. Whats the point of having a bum for a father your whole life? you are not going to learn anything from him so why keep him? I feel like a mother can raise a son the same as a father can, well at least my mother did.
arg35632	0.01262	It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been. Wondering what could have been is better than wondering how much better it could be.
arg35669	0.04412	Well, this is not an easy question to answer because both are kind of the same to me. But i would have to say fatherless because i'd rather have no man in my life than have somebody that isn't concerned about your life at all. To me that kind of is like being fatherless. I can always find another father figure or not even as much as a father figure, more like a male role model.
arg35705	0.01077	I think in any case its better to have no father then to have a lousy father either way you still lose. When you have a father you want him to be the best he can be so you can learn from him as you grow up. If you were to have a lousy father then whats the point of having a father at all if he's just going to be lousy and he wouldn't teach you anything. It's always better to have a respectable father figure in your life then to have a lousy father figure.
arg35706	0.01500	It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there. And theres always going to be other people by your side helping you get through life.
arg35718	0.00859	Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion). So yes, as opposed to having a lousy father that would rub off on me and mold me into half a man, I would much rather being fatherless.
arg35748	0.00859	Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.
arg35758	0.01903	I would rather be "fatherless" then having a "lousy father", because a "father" is supposed to be the man of the house and set a good example so the rest of the family can look up to him. So if I look up at a lousy father I might then be a lousy person, but if I had no father then I'll set the standards for my own self and step up and be the man of the house especially if I had younger brothers or sisters.
