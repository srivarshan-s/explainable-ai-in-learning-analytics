arg198954	0.00452	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.
arg199159	0.00466	I want to mention about wearing school uniform by high school students. it really makes no sense, it's the opposite, it just makes troubles within students and teachers relations. People aged 16-18 do not like any limits and sometimes limiting their freedom can become very serious problem followed by misunderstandings with the rest of people like parents and teachers. What about the controlling person's behavior - it must be done in the childhood, but not in the age when students become adults.
arg199549	0.00466	Another reason argued against school uniforms is that they deprive the children of their individuality. The stress on a uniform dress code in school opposes the spirit of unity in diversity and its celebration. It is even claimed to restrict socialization, a vital aspect of human nature.
arg200706	0.00452	We talk about how schools destroy creativity and uniforms are a classic example of that destruction. In most schools with uniforms the students are given the occasional day to were their casual clothes but are then given strict guidelines as to what is acceptable. This is effectively turning "casual clothes" into a twisted "causal" uniform.

arg238468	0.01078	I have always maintained that it is a good idea to wear a uniform to school. Why not? because it looks very nice and respectful. This shows the status of schools and students. I always liked to wear a uniform at my school, I felt like a schoolgirl, and brought up.
arg238471	0.00551	I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient. I don't have to worry about my clothes during my student days.
arg238473	0.00739	Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.
arg251309	0.00429	The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to "reduce bullying", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality.
