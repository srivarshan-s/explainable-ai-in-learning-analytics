arg110967	0.01035	phy. ed is just another class. students should start to be responsible for their actions by the time they are in highschool. if they are responsible with a car, then they should be responsible with their health. the tax payers also dont realize that they are paying for students to go swimming or play the whole hour.
arg202607	0.18455	Besides just a few people apply physical exercises in their life's!
arg203471	0.01361	Gym class is a useless class that students waste time in. There should be a test and if people can not run a mile without stopping every couple feet they should join. There is also the fact people can join to get prepared for sports. Students should have that class time to use it towards their careers and not a class that is just there.
arg216634	0.02489	P.E doesn't help fat kids the fat kids just eat too much or they are growing and eventually they will be normal.
arg245105	0.01075	i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.
arg271353	0.01019	OK no and yes I think p.e should be education which is teaching students how to eat right and live a healthy life style not making a fat kid run 10 laps around a track but showing them that eating right and exercise can BE FUN not having an obese child being bully because they can't run as fast as someone else. That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups
arg312577	0.01170	P.E. should be optional in 8th grade. If students want to participate, then so be it. However, in 8th grade students have a lot going on. That time may be used more beneficially by studying.
arg39274	0.01173	while yes phys. ed. classes should still be in high schools they shouldnt be mandatory(especially not all 4 years of HS). maybe just having PE be an optional class and having one year be a mandatory thing instead of a continuous PE class. in lower grades, yes it should be mandatory because little kids are more likely to gain and lose weight in weird patterns. That Is All.
arg485419	0.02131	Sport should not be compulsaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/> So man kids get bullied in pe because they are fatter then others or more unfit! Bullies pick there victims each day in pe so all u guys on the affirmative team are WRONG!
arg54267	0.01021	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. <br/> Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. <br/> Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.
