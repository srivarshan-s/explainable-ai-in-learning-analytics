arg229241	0.00469	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.
arg229484	0.00613	Even if there was a valid proof for the existence of god, there would be no valid proof that that god is Christian or not.
arg231491	0.00677	religious people are always using the same argument: you cant prove he doesn't exist!!!!you CANNOT disprove a negative. meaning, you cant prove something is not there,which already is not there.
arg231620	0.04044	For reasons that should be totally obvious, and which I would assume have been thoroughly fleshed out by others involved.
arg240623	0.01294	there is no god. Science has proven it. It was just an excuse made up so people from simplier times didnt have to think to hard on those big questions.
arg240625	0.03174	christians are also fun to lawl at because they waste half of their sunday going to church. What a waste!!!! HAHAHA
arg246334	0.00504	As humans, we cannot know exactly if there is a higher force or not. Christianity however is not it. Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. <br/> With Athe√Øsm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.
arg270902	0.00484	Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.
arg439197	0.00536	I'm sad to see the way this turned out. With not so little respect and so much spamming. I choose atheism over a Christianity because their is not enough evidence to soothe my curiosity. Christianity raises too many questions that it never answers.
arg575745	0.00501	No one ever said science is PERFECT. That's the difference between Religion and Science, Science admits it doesn't have all the answers while Religion is SO dogmatic enough to not even recognise FACTS. And even just what TRUTH really stands for.
