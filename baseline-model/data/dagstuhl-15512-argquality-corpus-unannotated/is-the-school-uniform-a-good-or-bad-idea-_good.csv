arg198376	0.00463	That's really good idea. As i remember every morning i though what was better to wear? It was really problem, i spent quiet a lot of time. I asked my parents to buy new clothes for me, it was happened not rare. I know that not everyone thought as me, but it much better if the school has own uniform and everybody has to follow it. First it looks very good, smart. Secondly there is no envy that somebody have really nice skirt or jeans. Every pupil is the same and it would be easy to study, to not think about another things!!
arg198417	0.00429	According to the legacy educational resources, as fashion and trends change, students become more concerned with how they look and how they are perceived than they do with their academic success and achievement. The fashion of low rise jeans, bagging jeans, large trench coats, low cut shirts, and many others contribute to behavior problems and safety issues in the classrooms and in the hallways of schools today.
arg200133	0.03769	school uniform does no harm to students life emotions now as for the point of expressing oneself imagine one bully wearing shirt,tie,pant all neatly ironed and well polished shoes wont he look good.remember dressing sense also is a part of ur interveiw
arg203869	0.00462	I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. <br/> But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.
arg203922	0.00653	yes, i believe it's nice to have a school uniform. Each school 's uniform signifies its goal for instant i wore white shirt and blue skirt in my school days, white color is an indication of peace and blue of fidelity in relationships moreover identical uniform also removes the wall of status. it also depicts that whether a child comes from high or low class they all are treated equally under one roof .
arg212151	0.01482	If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. <br/> Maybe I'm exaggerating. <br/> But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.
arg234411	0.00501	In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . <br/> Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . <br/> So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .
arg542561	0.00761	THE SCHOOL UNIFORM IS A VERY GOOOOOOOOOD IDEA , WHY ?? <br/> becouse the school uniform makes pupils concentrated on their education than on their clothes and I believe that school uniform instills discipline among pupils it makes pupils with diferent material statuses more equal :)
arg561672	0.00481	1. It makes everyone equal - if children can wear what they want some children will teased and feel less equal to their peers around them vs. uniforms <br/> 2. Okay Look school is for learning not how you look and dress but maybe in some levels it matters and most people that go to schools that don't have uniforms take like about 1 hr just to find their pants or shirt I mean really?? When you have a uniform it takes less than 10 min just to take it out and put it on and
arg660921	0.00496	yas,of course . School uniform is important <br/> 1.school uniform is a logos for our school <br/> 2.to remind us that we are part of the school <br/> 3.and if we use the uniform basically student used to think what are they gonna do to, is it positive or negative <br/> 4.in the morning we should use our uniform and if were not use our uniform the teacher give us a punishment and from that we can learn to be a discipline student <br/> 5.if we go out from the school than the teacher will see we used the school uniform so people will know that we from that school <br/> thankyou
