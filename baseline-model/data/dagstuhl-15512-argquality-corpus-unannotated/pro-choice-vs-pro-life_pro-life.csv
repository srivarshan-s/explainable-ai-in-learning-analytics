13260	0.00553	There are tons of ways to not get pregnant. There are condoms (99% effective) for men and women, there are morning-after pills (75% effective), the patch, pill, and other forms of ways not to get pregnant. It's the woman's fault that she didn't do it. <br/> And maybe instead of Pro-choice vs. Pro-life, they (i don't know who "they" is) should have pro-life, but with exceptions (i.e. women that get raped) so that it's fair all-around.
13270	0.00611	"If a women is raped" is a good argument. However why would you punish an innocent baby with the death penalty for some other man's crime. If the women does not want the child she could give it up for adoption. I just dont understand why you would kill the baby, the emotional trauma would happen without the baby as well.
13275	0.00603	"The government has no place to tell a woman what she can do with her own body, ever." <br/> The government DOES have that right. <br/> 1) a woman cannot legally prostitute herself in many states <br/> 2) a woman cannot take illicit drugs into her own body <br/> 3) a woman cannot use her body to murder others <br/> 4) a woman cannot use her body to steal <br/> 5) a woman cannot display her naked body in public <br/> there are many others. Men can also not do these things. <br/> The government tells us what to do with our bodies ALL THE TIME. This is no different.
13279	0.11836	In Nebraska, it's legal to have an abortion by killing the baby while it's coming out of the womb. How can you argue against that?
30319	0.00553	Statistics prove that less than 1% of women who are raped get pregnant because of the adrenalin rush. We have no right to take an unborn child's life. There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother. There are thousands of people on the waiting list for another baby to add to their family. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.
54474	0.00587	A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?
70668	0.00610	There is only one situation in which I believe abortion is okay. <br/> If a mother is incapable of giving birth to the child, and attempting it might kill her, I believe abortion is sad, but necessary. <br/> Otherwise, no one has the right to kill a child, born or unborn.
75146	0.01322	what we are dealing with is indirect murder if a women decides to abort a child she just had killed a life that may have been a big contribution to society
76937	0.01755	I choose life. Keeping the law pro-choice is allowing women to murder their own unborn human child.
