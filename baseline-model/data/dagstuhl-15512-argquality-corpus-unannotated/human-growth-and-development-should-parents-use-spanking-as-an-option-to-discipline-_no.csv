arg334934	0.00768	A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem. Also spanking shouldn't be an option because at that moment the parent would be full with anger and they wouldn't be thinking logically.
arg334943	0.00745	No because spanking might effects the relationship between the child and parents. And Children can pick up on the parents attitude acting violent. There are better ways to solve problems, for example using the other techniques.
arg334968	0.01007	Physical abuse towards children causes them to fear their parents and may cause a stutter.
arg335030	0.01299	Some kids don't learn by spanking them..So why waste your time on that, when you can always take something valuable away from them.
arg335091	0.04001	Parents shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline it just makes the child get mad than to see what they did wrong.
arg335095	0.00846	Spanking should not be an option to discipline a child, parents have a lot other options before spanking. Its better to talk to them about what they did wrong and solve the problem in a proper way.
arg335129	0.12456	I don't think anybody would have liked to get spanked by there parents therefore , spanking shouldn't be an Option
arg335564	0.00753	Nope. I believe it shouldnt be done just to discipline a child. Parents could just scold their child just so they would stop what they are doing wrong. Hitting is not really a solution because aside hurting a child emotionally, it also hurts them physically. Kids wouldnt learn the value of respect for their parents because they would only learn how to be scared. They wont do the wrong action again next time, not because they've learned their lesson, but because they are just scared that their parents would hit them
arg336179	0.00817	No because hitting your child could mentally scar them for life. also it can make them think hitting their kids is alright.
arg336204	0.00745	I strongly believe parents should not use physical punishment like spanking to discipline their child. The child will obey if they have a strong healthy relationship with a parent, if they have gained their respect. The parents should have a friendly relationship with their child and the child will soon respect them and agree to what their parents decide although they may not like it. They will learn that the parents know whats best for them.
